- **2)** The work of reachable is O(n+m)

- **4)** The reachable function is only called once since the graph is undirected. So the worst case is only once 

- **5)** The work of connected is O(n+m)

- **7)**  If we switched the graph to an adjacency matrix, the work would still be O(n+m) and would not change the overall work.
